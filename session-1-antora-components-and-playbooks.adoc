That's a lot of repositories.
Why are there so many?

By storing the documentation in separate repositories, the teams can manage documentation according to product version (alpha/beta/R.C., stable, EOL), use different processes per repository, and conduct faster review, merge, and release cycles because no set of documentation is blocked by another set of documentation.

== Branches and Versions

Master::
Contains documentation for unreleased features and the future product version.
New documentation for the next product version, its features, and non-bug related improvements should be based off of the master branch.

Release/$.$::
Contains the documentation specific to a corresponding stable product release.
Fixes related to product bugs and documentation errors in stable releases should be based off of the oldest supported release branch that is affected by the change.

== Repository Structure

The Couchbase documentation is organized into components.
Components have a standard directory structure and nomenclature.
This ensures Antora can locate the documentation components, collect the content files, and then build docs.couchbase.com.

=== What is a Component?

A component is usually a discrete product, service, integration, or library with its own user-facing lifecycle.
The C SDK is an example of a component.

image::sdk-selector.png[role=cover]

At the source level, a documentation component contains all the AsciiDoc page files, their optional assets, examples, and partial files, one or more navigation files, and a component descriptor file. These source files are organized in a repository in a specific structure so Antora can collect and catalog them.

image::docs-lite-master.png[role=cover]

A component isn't recognized by a repository or directory name.
Instead, it's the presence of the _antora.yml_ file that designates where a component is located.

=== Component Descriptor

When Antora finds _antora.yml_ in a repository, it knows it has located a component or part of component.

.Component Found!
image::docs-server-repo.png[role=cover]

The component descriptor classifies the files inside this hierarchy using the specified component name and component version (i.e., component version).

.Component Metadata
image::docs-server-antorayml-5-5.png[role=cover]

=== Modules

A module is a discrete bundle of content, including text, images, and other source materials, organized in a hierarchy of folders by content format, then by optional topic if needed.

image::docs-server-modules.png[role=cover]

A module is stored in the _modules_ directory.
A component can contain one or more modules.

The name of a module directory becomes part of the site URL

.Admin Module URL
image::server-url-admin.png[role=cover]

The ROOT module contains all the content that's directly associated with the component itself.

.The ROOT Module
image::docs-server-modules.png[role=cover]

When pages in the ROOT module are published, these pages are promoted a level above any other modules' pages in that component's URL.

image::server-url-root.png[role=cover]

=== Pages, Assets, and Examples

image::docs-lite-root.png[role=cover]

The _pages_ directory contains a module's AsciiDoc files.
These files are automatically converted to standalone HTML pages.

.Pages
image::docs-lite-pages.png[role=cover]

The file name of a page becomes the URL fragment for that page.

Multimedia and supplemental files, organized by format, are stored in the _assets_ directory.
Photographs, screenshots, and graphic files in _assets/images_ are inserted into pages using the AsciiDoc image macro.

.Images
image::docs-lite-images.png[role=cover]

Non-AsciiDoc files, such as source code and data values, are stored in the _examples_ directory.
These files are often inserted into listing blocks using the AsciiDoc include directive.

.Examples
image::docs-lite-examples.png[role=cover]

==== Partials

Now let's go back to the _pages_ directory; there's one other optional folder named _{blank}_partials_.

.Partials
image::docs-lite-partials.png[role=cover]

The _{blank}_partials_ directory contains AsciiDoc files that aren't standalone pages.
These files are referenced by an include directive from a document in the _pages_ directory.

=== Navigation File

.Navigation File
image::docs-sdk-nav.png[role=cover]

A navigation file, often named _nav.adoc_ contains one or more AsciiDoc lists.

[source,asciidoc]

Antora uses navigation files to build the site's component navigation menus.

image::sdk-component-menu.png[role=cover]

A navigation file must be declared in the component descriptor in order to be displayed in the component's navigation menu.

[source,yaml]
----
name: python-sdk
title: Python SDK
version: '2.2'
start_page: ROOT:start-using-sdk.adoc
nav:
- modules/ROOT/nav.adoc
server_version: '5.5'
----

If you're interested in learning more about how Antora assembles the site's navigation from source to menu, see {url-docs-antora}/navigation/[Navigation Assembly^]

== The Distributed Server Component

While it's common to find all of a component's files in a single repository, a component can be distributed across several repositories.
For example, the server component is aggregated from the _docs-server_, _couchbase-cli_, _backup_, _docs-analytics_, and _kafka-connect-couchbase_ repositories.

Let's look at the couchbase-cli repository.
Notice the _antora.yml_ file and the _modules/cli_ directory.
This repository contains a module named _cli_.

image::docs-cli-repo.png[role=cover]

When you open the _antora.yml_ file, you'll see that this _cli_ module is part of the Server 5.5 component.

image::cli-antorayml.png[role=cover]

If you go to the docs-server repository, you'll see that this repository also contains a module named _cli_.

image::docs-server-cli.png[role=cover]

Antora, using the information in each repositories' _antora.yml_ file, will aggregate the files in both _cli_ directories into a single _cli_ module.

.Page from the docs-server _cli_ directory.
image::cli-bucket.png[role=cover]

.Page from the couchbase_cli _cli_ directory.
image::cbanalyze.png[role=cover]

This capability is one of the reasons the component descriptor file, _antora.yml_, is so important.
It:

* Makes documentation portable.
* Decouples the repository structure from the documentation site output.
* Decouples branches from the documentation site output.

== The Docs Site Repository

The docs-site repository contains:

* The Home component (site home page and contribute module)
** The home component is typically organizational documentation not specific to any product or version
* Custom extensions
* Site playbooks

image::docs-site-repo.png[role=cover]

=== Extensions

These extensions were developed exclusively for the Couchbase documentation.

image::extensions.png[role=cover]

=== Playbooks

A playbook is a recipe for a site and an environment.

* Production
* Staging
* Local, and more

Let's walk through the key-value pairs that instruct Antora during the creation of the site.

.Build This Site
[source,yaml]
----
site:
  title: Couchbase Docs (Staging) # <1>
  url: https://docs-staging.couchbase.com # <2>
  start_page: home::index.adoc # <3>
----
<1> Title of the site
<2> Canonical URL of the site
<3> Location of the site's home page

.Look For Components Here
[source,yaml]
----
content:
  branches: release/* # <1>
  sources:
  - url: . # <2>

  - url: git@github.com:couchbase/couchbase-operator.git # <5>
    branches: [beta2, master] # <6>
    start_path: docs/user
----
<1> When collecting content from the repositories listed under the content key, use branches starting with `release/` unless other branches are specifically named.
<2> Antora is run from the docs-site repository, so the location of the repository is simply specified by a dot `.`.
<3> Only collect files from the current working tree of the docs-site repository.
<4> Start looking for the content files in the _home_ directory of the repository.
<5> Find the couchbase-operator repository at this URL.
<6> Only collect files from the `beta2` and `master` branches.

=== What Antora Does When You Run It With A Playbook

image::how-antora-works.png[role=cover]

If you want to learn how Antora processes the content files, see {url-docs-antora}/how-antora-works/[How Antora Works].

== Prepare Your System

Antora runs on most Linux distributions, macOS, and Windows.
Follow the prerequisite instructions to install the base build tools and Node 8 on your operating system:

* {url-linux}[Linux: Install base build tools and Node^]
* {url-macos}[macOS: Install Xcode and Node^]
* {url-windows}[Windows: Install Chocolatey and Node^]

Some of the Couchbase documentation is stored in private repositories.
In order for Antora to access these repositories from your device, you need to have your SSH agent running.

.Don't Forget to Start Your SSH Agent!
 $ eval $(ssh-agent -s)
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

See {url-docs-antora}/playbook/private-repository-auth/#configure-your-ssh-agent[Configure Your SSH Agent^] for detailed instructions.

== Install Antora

To build the Couchbase documentation site on your computer, you need the Antora command line interface (CLI) and the Antora site generator.

In your terminal, type:

 $ nvm use 8
 $ npm install -g @antora/cli @antora/site-generator-default

Verify the `antora` command is available on your PATH:

 $ antora -v

If installation was successful, you should see the Antora version number displayed in the console.

== Get the Docs Site Repository

Now that Antora is installed, you need to get the Couchbase playbook project.

. Go to the {url-git-playbook}[Docs Site repository^] on GitHub and click btn:[Fork].
. Create or select the local folder where you want to store the repository on your device, then open a terminal and change into that folder.

 $ cd path/to/folder

. Go to your repository on GitHub, and click btn:[Clone or download].
. Click the Clipboard icon to copy the repository's Git URL.
. In your terminal type `git clone`, paste the copied URL, and press kbd:[Enter].

 $ git clone git@github.com:this-is-you/docs-site.git

. Change into the repository folder created by the clone operation.

 $ cd docs-site

. List the contents of docs-site.

 $ ls

You should see a file named _staging-antora-playbook.yml_.
This is the playbook you'll use to build the documentation site on your computer.

== Run Antora

Make sure you're still in the doc-site directory.
You have to run Antora from this directory so it can access the extensions.

To run Antora, type `antora` and then the name of the staging playbook:

 docs-site $ antora staging-antora-playbook

The cloning progress of each component repository is displayed in the console, followed by any AsciiDoc or Antora warning and error messages.
The site generation is complete when the command prompt (`$`) reappears in the terminal.

Antora generated the site into a directory named _public_.
Switch to it.

 docs-site $ cd public

On some operating systems, you can open the site directly from the command line by typing `open` and the name of an HTML file.

 public $ open index.html

Or, you can navigate to and open _index.html_ using your file explorer or browser.

.Success!
image::docs-site.png[role=cover]

== What's Next

Now it's your turn to install Antora and run it on your computer with the staging playbook.

* Install Antora on your computer
* Fork and clone the Docs Site repository
* Build the site on your computer with the staging playbook

If you get stuck, join the https://gitter.im/opendevise/couchbase-docs-training[training chat room] for help and to ask any questions.

Next week, we'll focus on using Atom to work with GitHub and your documentation repositories, the special AsciiDoc features your documentation set uses, common gotchas, and testing your changes using a local playbook and Antora.
